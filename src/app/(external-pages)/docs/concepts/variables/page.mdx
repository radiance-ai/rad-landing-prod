# Understanding JavaScript Variables

JavaScript variables are fundamental to how we handle data in the language. Variables can be thought of as named containers where we can store, manipulate, and retrieve data values. In JavaScript, we have different ways of declaring variables - `var`, `let`, and `const`.

## The 'var' Keyword

The `var` keyword is the oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript. It's been around since the beginning of the language.

```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var sum = x + y;
console.log(sum); // 11
```

In this example, we declare three variables `x`, `y`, and `sum`.

> Note: Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped, meaning they exist within the function they were declared in, or globally if declared outside a function. One peculiar behaviour of `var` is 'hoisting', where variables can be referenced before they're declared.

## The 'let' Keyword

The `let` keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6. `let` provides block scoping, which means the variable is only available within the block where it's declared. This can be more predictable and easier to work with compared to `var`.

```javascript
let a = 5;
let b = 6;
let product = a * b;
console.log(product); // 30
```

In this code snippet, `a`, `b`, and `product` are variables declared with `let`. If we tried to reference `a`, `b`, or `product` outside of their block, we would get an error.

## The 'const' Keyword

The `const` keyword, also introduced in ES6, is used to declare variables that are constant, or immutable. Once a `const` variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned.

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
console.log(PI); // 3.14159
```

In this example, `PI` is a constant variable that holds the value of pi. If you try to reassign PI to another value, you would get an error.

> Note: While `const` variables are immutable, this doesn't apply to their properties if the variable is an object. So, `const` objects can have properties changed or added.

## Variable Naming Rules

Variable names in JavaScript have to follow certain rules:

1. They should begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (\_). They cannot start with a number.
2. They can include alphanumeric characters, but no spaces or special characters, except for $ and \_.
3. Variable names are case sensitive.

For example, `myVar`, `_myVar`, `my_var`, `$myVar` are all valid variable names, but `123myVar`, `my var`, `my-var` are not.

In conclusion, understanding JavaScript variables and their rules is foundational to mastering the language. The `var`, `let`, and `const` keywords offer different options for variable declaration and scope, each with its own use cases and quirks. As you write more JavaScript, you'll get a better feel for when to use each one.
